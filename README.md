## Todos 
    [x] Expense Categories:
        Instead of just a free-form "type of expense," consider creating predefined categories like "Food," "Transportation," "Entertainment," etc. This will help users categorize their expenses consistently, making it easier to analyze spending patterns.
    [x] Date and Time Stamp:
        Include a date and time stamp for each expense entry. This can help users track when each expense was made, making it easier to understand spending trends over time.
    [x] Expense History and Trends:
        Create a history section that displays past expenses over time. Visualize trends and patterns using line charts or bar graphs to help users understand their spending habits.  
    - Data Visualization:
        You mentioned a pie chart, which is a great start. Consider adding other types of visualizations like bar charts, line charts, and histograms to provide users with a comprehensive view of their spending.
